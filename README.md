# Iron Ark: Wasteland Chronicles

> **A post-apocalyptic text-based RPG powered by Google Gemini**

**Iron Ark** is an immersive AI-driven text adventure game set in a wasteland world. Built with a "narrative-instruction separation" architecture, it leverages the advanced context window of **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to deliver dynamic storytelling and complex state management.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **AI-Powered Narrative Engine**: Dynamic story generation utilizing Gemini's long-context capabilities.
- **Strict Narrative-Instruction Separation**: Logs for storytelling, Tavern Commands for state changes.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Pre-planning and post-validation ensure logical consistency in the wasteland.
- **Modular Prompt System**: World-building, rules, writing style, and loot systems based on specialized system instructions.
- **Immersive Terminal UI**: Wasteland-themed green terminal interface with AI thinking process visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API
- **State Management**: Custom hooks and context

My Contribution: This project is a UI/UX Redesign Variant focused on immersive storytelling. While retaining the excellent Gemini narrative engine from the original DXC project, I have:

Redesigned the entire interface into a "Wasteland Terminal" style.

Optimized the visual hierarchy for better player immersion.

Refined the prompt engineering for a darker, post-apocalyptic tone.

Made with ❤️ for the wasteland survivors
